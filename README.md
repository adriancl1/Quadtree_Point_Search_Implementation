# Optimized search algorithm research

This project is a research about how to optimize search algorithms. 
After searching for a lot of information, I decided to try the quadtree, in the repository I have generated two codes, the one named "Olivenza_Xavier_Research_Optimized_Search_Manager_first_Iteration_slower" is my first attempt, which is slow, but then I generate the one named "Olivenza_Xavier_Research_Optimized_Search_Manager_second_Iteration_faster" which really works and is faster (if you are looking for some quadtree to implement take the one from this second project). There are also two PDFs with theoretical information of my search for information (one in English and the other in Spanish), with some help links, but to understand the code, the better you enter the project and look at the multiple code comments of the SDLQuadtree.h / .cpp files (they are named like this because I use SDL_Rect and some SDL functions) and j1Scene.h / .cpp. In the first files are the implementation of quadtree, and in the seconds are where I use it.

## Usage
###How to use the Quadtree


###Debug
R  ➣ Regenerates a new quadtree with new points.

S  ➣ Search, in this project, brute force and quadtree search will be performed.

F1 ➣ See the whole generated quadtree.

F2 ➣ Activate the "see quadtree steps mode". To start seeing something, press Q.

Q  ➣ In "see quadtree steps mode", add one step.

A  ➣ In "see quadtree steps mode", remove one step.
